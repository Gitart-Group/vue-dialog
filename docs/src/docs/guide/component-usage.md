# Component Usage

To use the package you don't need install the plugin. 
Just styles and register GDialog component. In some cases it's enough

<<< @/.vitepress/includes/minumal-working-example/main.js
<<< @/.vitepress/includes/minumal-working-example/YourComponent.js
<<< @/.vitepress/includes/minumal-working-example/YourComponent.html
<!-- 
<BaseDialog />

Pretty **ugly** dialog, right? Let's add max-width, background and some padding. Take a look:

<BaseStyledDialog /> -->
